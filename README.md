# Artwork Gallery - Learning React

This project serves as a learning playground for me to explore and understand the fundamentals of React. It is a website that showcases the artwork of a talented artist with over 40 years of experience in various art forms, including Pottery, Glass & Mosaic, Marble, Paint, Abstract Art & Design, and much more.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with React and enhance my skills in front-end web development. I will be implementing features such as:

- Creating a Masonry Gallery to display the artist's diverse artwork.
- Adding a Contact and Inquiry section for potential customers to communicate with the artist.

Please note that while I'm open to suggestions and discussions, this is a personal learning project, and direct contributions will not be accepted. However, your insights will be acknowledged and may help shape the project's direction.
